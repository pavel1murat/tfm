* TFM : the Trigger Farm Manager                                             
- forked from artdaq_daqinterface/fc/control/DAQInterface.py
- goals : 
  - reduce the number of transitions
  - reduce the transition times
  - encode run number in to filenames
  - get rid of symlinks in the logfile naming
  - make sure that the server can provide any diagnostics information needed for 
  - split configurations from the farm manager scripts themselves
  - provide troubleshooting of the farm performance
  - integrate with MIDAS as a frontend client

- NOTE: at this point, significant part of the documentation below is in a "core dump" state, 
  feel free to improve and commit back

** the TFM configuration is defined in a subdirectory containing the following files :
1) [[file:settings.org][settings]] : defines the farm configuration - components (executables)     
   and additional configuration parameters               

2) .FCL files : 

- long term: created starting from ODB
- one FCL file ber component
  - boardreaders  : brXX.fcl, for example br01.fcl
  - event builders: ebXX.fcl, for example eb01.fcl
  - data loggers  : dlXX.fcl, for example dl01.fcl
  - dispatchers   : dsXX.fcl, for example ds01.fcl

see self.get_config_info() there 

- after being copied, the files are checked for being unique 
  not sure how one can make such a mistake

- also what are multiple subconfigurations ?

   -- env['ARTDAQ_PARTITION_NUMBER'] is set by [[file:../bin/tfm_configure][tfm_configure]] and used by TFM

   -- the TFM port number = 10000+1000*partition_number, no need to improvise

   -- the configuration dir could be anywhere, and TFM should not be 
      making assumptions about it

   -- after sourcing the [[file:../bin/tfm_configure][tfm_configure]] script, only need to specify the configuration directory 
      (when debugging a given configuration, may want to create a copy)
* interaction with the Postgres DB                                           
- if /Mu2e/RunConfigurations/$config_name/UseDBRunInfo is set to "yes" , 
  the MIDAS sequencer requests the new run number from the PG and stores it in ODB
  the [[file:../../frontends/tfm_frontend/tfm_launch_fe.cc][tfm_launch_fe]] then passes that to ARTDAQ and records all transitions

- MIDAS, via MSL, executes script [[file:../../frontends/tfm_frontend/get_next_run_number.sh]] 
  which returns the next run number to /Sequencer/Variables/SCRIPT_RESULT 

- here is the MSL script
#+begin_src
# -*- mode:text -*-
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# last step before starting a run
# get next run number from the run info DB. 
# get_next_run_number is an executable which gets the run number from Postgresql and updates 
# the run number in ODB
# for example, the end_run would write into the ODB some flag, w/o which one couldn't start the run 
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
script get_next_run_number
#+end_src

- [[file:../../frontends/tfm_frontend/get_next_run_number.cc]] gets compiled into 
  the executable interacting with the DB via a clone of Antonio's code - 
  see [[file:../../frontends/tfm_frontend/db_runinfo.hh]]

- comment: this is the first iteration, the code should be cleaned up

* log file naming                                                            
  [[file:../rc/control/farm_manager.py::/def determine_logfilename/]]

  log file names defined during the boot transition 
  -- do_boot
     -- get_artdaq_log_filenames

  -- logfiles are created at boot step, on my laptop/docker this step for config='demo'
     took from 00:07:53 to 00:09:03, out of that:
  -- 38 sec - not sure what
  -- 10 sec - check of the setup script
  -- 19 sec - launch of the artdaq processes
  --  2 sec - associating log files

  self.launch_attempt_files[p.host] : PMT log file (used in manage_processes_direct.py
  
- all art processes have their COUT redirected to the PMT log file

- however, messages by message_facility go into individual log files, one per 
art process

1) TFM assumes that all config files , including FCLs are located in a directory 
provided to it at a startup , so the rest transitions do not really need a configuration
parameter
2) startup executed old boot
3) run number is specified at old config
4) new start doesn't execute old config - config should be a separate step , 
   as there are multiple subsystems, and at 'configured' all shoudl be ready to run
5) stop is stop, after stop - either configure or shutdown
6) at 'shutdown', the farm manager exits, requiring a new start
* types of artdaq components                                                 
  BoardReader, EventBuilder, DataLogger, Dispatcher, RoutingManager
  - as follows from the names, an artdaq component is a job with a given functionality
  - components can run on the same or different nodes
  - components can talk to each other via XML-RPC 
  - components can be combined into subsystems, by default there is only one subsystem

** at startup, TFM goes directly into a 'booted' state                       
- 'config' and 'start' are merged into 'start'
- 'config' step defines new run number and configures the farm for that
- stop actually stops the processes
- stable states  : 'initialized', 'running', 'paused', 'stopped'
- commands: Init , Start, Pause, Resume, Stop, Shutdown
- transition commands sent by [[file:../bin/tfm_transition][tfm_transition]]
  - boot,
  - config
  - start :
    - if run number is not defined, use next one to the last found
    - if run number is defined, use that, send "starting struct/{run_number:i/$rn}"
  - enable
  - disable
  - stop
  - terminate
